# 👑 Python Software Engineering Portfolio

This repository documents my journey and skills acquired during an intensive **"Python Course,"** resulting in a collection of **16 fully functional, command-line applications.**

My work demonstrates mastery over core software development concepts essential for a Junior Developer role.

## 🚀 Key Skills & Concepts Mastered

| Concept Area | Skills Demonstrated | Projects Featuring This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, `__init__`, `__str__` | Student System, ATM Systems, **University Management**, Train Booking System |
| **Data Persistence (ETL)** | Extract-Transform-Load Logic (`load_data`, `save_to_json`), File I/O (`.txt`, `.json`) | **University Management**, ATM Systems, Student System, Password Vault |
| **Advanced File System Operations** | Using Python's `os` and `shutil` libraries to inspect, move, and organize files based on complex logic. | My_Sorter.py |
| **Custom Function Decorators** | Implementing `@decorator` syntax for auditing and logging specific function calls (e.g., enrollment). | University Course Management System, Project Management System |
| **Flow Control & Logic** | Complex `if/elif/else` chains, nested `for`/`while` loops, input validation. | Quiz Engine, CLI Task Manager |
| **Data Structures** | Implementing and manipulating Dictionaries, Lists, and Tuples, often storing complex nested objects (e.g., lists of class instances). | E-Commerce Inventory, Ultimate Phonebook, Train Booking System |
